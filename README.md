After cloning the repository, execute the MATLAB application. Here, two image filenames should be specified for matching, such as "image1.png" (without the quotiations). The images should be contained within the directory of the project.

If "Montage" is chosen as the visualization method, the images are put side by side and matched features are indicated from one image to another. If "Stack" is chosen, the images are put onto together.
